## transform
The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model.

## transition
The transition CSS property is a shorthand property for `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function`, `transition-delay`, and `transition-behavior`.

## keyframes
The `@keyframes` CSS at-rule controls the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence by defining styles for keyframes (or waypoints) along the animation sequence. This gives more control over the intermediate steps of the animation sequence than transitions.

## animation-fill-mode
The `animation-fill-mode` CSS property sets how a CSS animation applies styles to its target before and after its execution.

## animation-iteration-count
The `animation-iteration-count` CSS property sets the number of times an animation sequence should be played before stopping.

## animation-direction
The `animation-direction` CSS property sets whether an animation should play forward, backward, or alternate back and forth between playing the sequence forward and backward.

## animation-timing-function
The `animation-timing-function` CSS property sets how an animation progresses through the duration of each cycle.
