## transform
The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model.

## transition
The transition CSS property is a shorthand property for `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function`, `transition-delay`, and `transition-behavior`.

## keyframes
The @keyframes CSS at-rule controls the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence by defining styles for keyframes (or waypoints) along the animation sequence. This gives more control over the intermediate steps of the animation sequence than transitions.
